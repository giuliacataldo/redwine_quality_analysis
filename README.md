# redwine_quality_analysis
I worked on this project with three classmates of mine, as a part of our Applied Linear Models course.
We picked a dataset containing scores given by experts to different red wines and their respective properties.
Our final goal was to determine which are the physiochemical properties that most inlfuence the quality of red wine, and to do so we implemented a binomial and a multinomial model.
We then proceeded to compare them and draw conclusions.
